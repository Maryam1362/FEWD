#FEWD Week #9 Project: Bootstrap and Positioning

---


###Description


In a past assignment, we helped the hot new startup, Relaxr, make their site responsive. Now that we have Bootstrap's grid system in our toolkit, let's implement a responsive Relaxr website using Bootstrap. Additionally, we'll use what we've learned about advanced CSS positioning to fix the top navigation and social links.
